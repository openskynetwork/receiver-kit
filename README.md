### Introduction

This guide explains how to assemble and setup your OpenSky kit. After following this guide your kit will be connected to the OpenSky Network and you will be able to view the data your kit is collecting by logging into your OpenSky profile on [https://opensky-network.org]().

### Overview

The OpenSky kit consists of the following parts:

##### (1) The RaspberryPi
  * 1x RaspberryPi 3 Model B *(A)*
  * 1x RaspberryPi Universal Power Supply *(B)*
  * 1x big chip cooler *(C)*
  * 1x small chip cooler *(D)*
  
##### (2) The Case
  * 1x OpenSky RaspberryPi case *(E)*, *(F)*, *(G)*
  * 4x screws + 1x spare screw *(H)*
  
##### (3) 1x SD card containing the OpenSky receiver image

##### (4) 1x RTL-SDR USB dongle

##### (5) 1x Jetvision A3 ADS-B antenna 1090 MHz

##### (6) 1x Antenna mounting backet

##### (7) 1x 15m low loss coax cable

### Assembling the receiver

Remove the protection cardboard from the bottom of the coolers (C) and (D) and place them onto the chips of the RaspberryPi (A):

Take the RPi (A) and place it onto the bottom part of the case (E). You will notice that the four screwholes of the RPi will be aligned with the screwholes in (E). The best way to insert the RPi is to push the 3.5 mm audio jack into the designated hole in the case (see the red circle below) and then push down the RPi, until it sits perfectly.

Gently push the rear panel (G) of the case into position and make sure the SD card slot is on the bottom (see the red circle below).

The RaspberryPi should be powering up, which is indicated by an LED behind the rear panel of the case or the LAN traffic indicators on the LAN port.
